// YOU DO: Add two methods to the `lunchOrder` object below.
  // 1. `prepare` - log out a sentence to let the user know the order is being worked on.
  // 2. `complete` - log out a sentence to let the user know the order is complete.

// Log to the console each property on the `lunchOrder` object.
// Call each method and run the file in node to verify they are working as expected.

  complete: function() {

/*I thought this initially, but then changed to what is not commented out:
//console.log(lunchOrder.dish);
//console.log(lunchOrder.beverage);
//console.log(lunchOrder.tableNumber);

//console.log(lunchOrder.complete);*/
