## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
  I felt different in that it helped break up my work and I found the breaks refreshing. I think I need to be a bit more convinced by, meaning doing it more to discover specifically what works well for me, the pomodoro technique. I think it's a suitable and helpful practice to implement, but will take more time doing to comfortably settle in to. I think I'll buy a mechanical timer to facilitate this.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript? Objects are things in Javascript that are essentially a group of properties. Each property describes another piece or aspect of the object. An array is more simply just a list of different data points and an object can represent and do more. I think of an array as a list of nouns/adjectives and an object as a list of nouns/adjectives/verbs/etc.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class: an array because it is easily represented by a simple list and could be as simple as just student names. If you were to include other qualities such as work that each student did or preferences an object may be more beneficial, but a list of student names is suitable as an array.
  * List of states and their capitals: an array, because there are two "spots" for information: city and state. There is little else to do with the capitals and they could be easily worked with via an Array.
  * List of things to pack for vacation: This seems like it would be best served as a simple list and would be best served as an array, particularly if it is used solely for packing. Once completed it could be checked off the list or removed from the array, but more complicated of involved action is not needed.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow: An object would be better to store because an object and object instances would be able to not only able to display account name, but also other characteristics such as
  * List of student names and their cohort: This could be handled suitably by an array as it is a simple list of each name and FE/BE.  
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake: An array or object could work for this application, but it would depend on how this information would be used. I think an array would be suitable to address the ingredient and amount, or perhaps two arrays, but that there would not be a necessary benefit in placing information in an object. Again, it comes down to _how_ the data is used.
  * All my favorite restaurants: This depends on the complexity. If it were a simple list an array would suffice. However, if multiple aspects of the restaurant were to be included (ethnicity, price, location, etc) an object would be preferable.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values? The app I've consistently referenced in this prework is Strava (running/biking/exercise recording app) and I think that each exercise would be an object. A run for example would have time, date, distance, time running, GPS location, photos uploaded to the run, comments, kudos(likes), etc.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects? I don't know that I have solid questions as of yet, although I'm sure they will come. I feel like the basic idea makes sense, but the true understanding will only be gained by working with them over time. I think my question then is what will further and more experience teach me about working with classes and/or objects, which is something that can only be answered by time and experience.
