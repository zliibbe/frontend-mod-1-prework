## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
I appreciated the Super Learner article and it resonated with me in that I agree that these are important qualities. I really liked the growth mindset and viewing learning as a growing process. I think I have a grow mindset and teach others what I know. I think I could be better about taking short breaks, which I currently don't do often enough. I could certainly try taking  breaks more frequently.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
*String: any combination of letters, numbers, and/or special characters written with the intent of being read by another
*Number: Any number, positive or negative, whole number or a decimal value
*Boolean: describing data in a binary way as either True or False

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console? console.log('Hello World!');

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment? // for a single-line comment and beginning with /* and ending with */ for multi-line comments

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old? A variable is a way of holding information with a descriptive name. The name is like a box that can hold whatever you put into it. Certain variables hold only certain types of information, which is kind of like having a specific box for each type of data.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold? I use Strava to track runs and bike rides. A variable might be the miles run/ridden. Another example of a variable is the GPS location of the beginning of the activity. A third variable might be the time spent doing the activity.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is. It is a process of joining together strings and variables outside of strings using plus signs between strings and variables

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention? When using Strava, the app will greet me with a message and use my name. It is likely concatenting my name into the display.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option) I'm curious if the data Types listed are comprehensive for all data contained within programming or even if that is a possible potential thing to do.
