## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
The point that resonated with me most was "By understanding that mistakes are _essential_ to learning". I think that this is a true perspective and I believe I have the tendency to want to tray and avoid mistakes at all costs. The perspective in the article encourages me to embrace mistakes and not shy away from that. That resonates with me because I believe I learn more when I make a mistake and have to correct. I'd like to lean into my mistakes rather than shy away from them (for the sake of learning, not just to make mistakes!).

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_? I think I demonstrate a Growth Mindset with my awareness of what I'm good at and where I need to grow. I think I could always have more understanding of what I'm lacking in. It would behoove me to do regular self-inventory so I'm aware of my own understanding and areas of grow. I think I need to realize that it is ok to struggle. I tend to be too hard on myself. Rather than do that I'd like to make a practice of listing and make mental action notes in my mind or on paper to improve my current condition.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
Thinking of Spotify, one way that the information could be categorized, is each album as an array of strings naming each track on the album. Spotify could use this information to group albums together or iterate through an album to play songs. This is likely not the actual way that Spotify is organized, but at least carries the idea of how arrays might work in the context of an app.


1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
 An array method is a keyword that is added to the name of an array after a period (.) to form a particular function that affects the contents of the array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
A loop is a way to perform a task each time the loop is run. A loop is meant to do the same thing (e.g. line of code) over and over until instructed to stop. A loop used in conjunction with an array can do something, or multiple things to items in an array. A loop used without an array might perform a repetative task, e.g. counting or printing names on a list.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
Loops are ways of performing the same action on multiple items. An example in real-life might be, raking leaves. When you're raking leaves, you are using the rake to gather leaves on the ground. Each stroke of the rake is doing essentially the same thing in a different part of the yard. A loop is performing an action over and over in the same way to whatever we want the action to be done to.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops? I'm curious about the different types of loops mentioned in the video (for, while, do...while, for...in, for..o.f). When are these used and why/how are they different. I think I have a solid conceptual understanding of loops as of now, but I'm curious to learn more.
