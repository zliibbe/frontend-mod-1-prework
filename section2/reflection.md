## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
I tend to wait too long if anything. For instance I was having difficulty with pushing Section 1 work to GitHub and worked on that for far too long prior to asking for proper help. Or maybe I asked properly, but because my Mod 0 slack channel was less responsive as prework was already due for everyone, no one answered. I also sent messages to my instructors, but did not hear back. I was able to talk with a friend over zoom who is a software developer. He is familiar with Git and was able to help me rectify my problem. All that to say, I think I could ask questions sooner and not be so hard on/judgmental of myself for having to ask.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
I think it was uncomfortably comfortable. I appreciated that Turing is open to and encouraging of the use of outside materials, but that also results in feeling, potentially, overwhelmed by information. I think it is potentially overwhelming to consider all potential options, rather than the tightly constrained objects/material in a class syllabus for example.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use. A conditional statement uses if/else syntax to describe how to parse through and respond to information. Daily life example: "*If* my hair is dirty, *then* wash it. Otherwise (*else*), no need to wash it." Web application example: *If* username and password is entered, attempt log in. *Else*, ask for missing information (username and/or password).

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
You would use the syntax to add conditions sequentially using 'else if'. A program will read each condition in order and evaluate if the condition applies or not. If it does not apply it will continue on to the next condition, ending and executing 'else' if no other conditions are met.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code? To check that 2 conditions are met, I would use &&, the logical AND operator. To check if 1 of 2 conditions, I would use ||, the logical OR operator.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions? Is there a more comprehensive list of comparison operators in JavaScript or did this list (===, ==, !=. >, >=, <, <=, &&, ||) cover the main ones?
